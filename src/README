#README file for CSCI 6431, Computer Networks, GWU Summer 2014
#Project 2, HTTP Proxy Server

Compiling is simple;
- Requirements: latest version of Java SDK installed
- ensure javac is accessible through your path.
- cd into the src directory
- type "javac csci6431/*.java"; this will compile the two java files and output 
	- csci6431/HTTPProxyServer.class, and 
	- csci6431/ProxyThread.class.

Running is also simple:
- type "java csci6431.HTTPProxyServer <port number>".
- The server is multi-threaded so each time you connect to the server it will start a new ProxyThread on a different port,
handle the request, and return the response to the calling process.
